In order to execute the project, run the python script: Automated_Tester.py.

The script does the following:

	1) Checks whether all dependencies sre present.
	2) Compiles the three C++ programs and generates the executables.
	3) Generates a random graph and stores it in a text file.
	4) Times the two algorithms on the graph.
	5) Stores the graph specifications (# of vertices and # of edges) along with the time taken by the two algorithms in Results.txt.
