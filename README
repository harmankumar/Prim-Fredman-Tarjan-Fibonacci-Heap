This Project Compares the running times of Prims algorithm and Fredman-Tarjan algorithm for computing the MST of graphs.

In order to implement the algorithms, Fibonacci Heap, Union Find and Binary Heap data structures were implemented. 

In theoretical sense, Fibonacii heaps are more efficient as compared to binary heaps.
